## Building
In order to build DashWeatherExtension, you must use [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) and have [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/kotlin-android.html) plugin configured for it. 

Once imported into AndroidStudio, you will need to acquire an API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/). These keys are free, but your requests are only free for the first 1,000 a day. If you make more than 1,000 API request in a day, you will be charged.

When you have an API key, either create or edit the `gradle.properties` file in the projects root directory and add the config `API_KEY = "YOUR API KEY"` where "YOUR API KEY" is the key you obtained by [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/appid).
